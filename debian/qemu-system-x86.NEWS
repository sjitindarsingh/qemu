qemu (1:2.5+dfsg-5ubuntu10.9) xenial; urgency=low

  The ubuntu specific machine types for Trusty, Utopic had a bug in
  former versions. Those bugs made them non-unique by effectively picking up
  the current qemu versions machine type instead to stay at their defined one.

  Machine Type:  Broken in:
  Trusty         Xenial, Yakkety, Cloud-Archive Mitaka
  Utopic         Vivid, Wily, Xenial, Cloud-Archive Liberty

  Despite multiple releases being affected by the bad type definition, most
  common migration paths today like LTS->LTS from Trusty to Xenial are working
  fine for now. But a latter Migration to a newer System would fail as then
  source and target would disagree on what the guest type exactly is.

  The only known real case of a related issue so far is a Utopic machine type on
  Trusty plus Ubuntu Cloud Archive Liberty migrating to Xenial.

  SRUs for bug 1641532 are rolled out into all affected releases to fix that
  issue and let qemu do the right for the machine type definition as it was
  meant to do.

  If you have a guest with an affected machine type running on one of the
  affected releases and are hit by the migration issues the procedure to get
  migrations working again required a guest restart to pick up the changes.
    1. With this fix installed restart the guest to pick up the "fixed" machine
       type (the same as with many CVE qemu fixes).
    2. Now it can be migrated to a target Host with the fix applied as well

qemu (1.7.0+dfsg-2) unstable; urgency=low

  Since version 1.7.0+dfsg-2, qemu-system-x86 switched from vgabios for
  plex/bochs project to implementation of vgabios provided by seabios.
  The latter is written almost entirely in C language so it is much easier
  to debugu/develop, but it lacks some 16bit protected mode functions which
  are present in vgabios.  This means that it is possible that, for eaxample,
  some protected-mode games written for MS-DOS may not work since this
  release.

  This also means that vgabios package isn't used by qemu anymore, and might
  be removed from the system if there are no other users of it left.


  /usr/bin/kvm shell wrapper has been moved back to qemu-kvm package (it was
  moved to qemu-system-x86 in version 1.3.0+dfsg-2exp).  Please note that we
  do not re-install qemu-kvm package if it has been removed as obsolete, so
  if you need /usr/bin/kvm wrapper please install qemu-kvm package again.
  This change allows qemu-system-x86 package to co-exist with the old qemu-kvm
  binary (not shell-wrapper) package from wheezy.
